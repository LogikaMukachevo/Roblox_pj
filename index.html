    <h1>they also have abilities</h1>
    <h2>Noob:</h2>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/a/a1/ColaCore.png"/>
    <p>Bloxy Cola</p>
    <p>Noob drinks a can of Bloxy Cola for 2.5 seconds, granting them Speed I for 10 seconds and removing all existing
      Slowness effects. While drinking, Noob cannot sprint and has 10% less speed.</p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/f/f7/SlateskinCore.png"/>
    <p>Slateskin Potion</p>
    <p>Noob drinks a bottle of Slateskin Potion for 1.5 seconds, giving them Slateskin II for 6 seconds, providing 80
      overheal but slowing them by 45%. The ability can be recast after 2.5 seconds of usage to remove the effect
      manually. If Slateskin wears off naturally (waiting for the Slateskin effect to wear off), Noob gains Speed II for 2
      seconds, but if it is ended manually, it only gives Speed I. While drinking, Noob has 40% less speed and cannot
      sprint. Unlike other abilities, the cooldown for this ability only triggers once Noob's Slateskin effect wears off.

      that Undetectable doesn't work if they're the last survivor standing. While eating, Noob has 40% less speed. Using
      this when minions are chasing you or when you are highlighted by an ESP ability (such as 1x1x1x1 Unstable Eye) earns
      you the Deodorant achievement.</p>
    <h2>Elliot:</h2>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/b/bf/Pizza_toss%2C_Elliot.png"/>
    <p>Pizza Throw</p>
    <p>Elliot tosses a pizza infront of him that can instantly heal other survivors for 15 HP then it heals 20 HP over 2.5
      seconds.</p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/0/08/Rush_Hour%2C_Elliot.png"/>
    <p>Rush Hour</p>
    <p>After Elliot heals any player, except for other Elliots, they gain a charge for this ability.

      charge</p>
    <h2>Shedletsky:</h2>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/7/76/Shedletsky_slash.png"/>
    <p>SLASH</p>
    <p>Shedletsky slashes forward, dealing 30 damage and stunning the killer for 3 seconds if it hits. Upon activation,

    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forsaken2024/images/5/51/Fried_chicken.png"/>
    <p>FRIED CHICKEN</p>
    <p>Shedletsky pulls out a piece of fried chicken and takes a bite out of it, immediately restoring 5 HP and 35 HP
      across the span of 10 seconds. Using this slows him by 75% for 3 seconds. If Shedletsky is hit at any point, the
      regeneration is cancelled. Note that this depends on which way you are hit, and as such, minions cannot interrupt
      your healing. This ability only has two charges before becoming unusable.</p>
